# Project TODO & Future Plans

This document tracks completed tasks and outlines future feature enhancements for the Maktab project.

### Future Plan

*   **Add Quranic Examples:** Show a few common Quranic words for each letter to give real-world examples. This involves adding an `examples` array to the `letterData` object.

*   **Audio Pronunciation:** Play the letter's sound when its modal (popup box) opens. Requires creating audio files (e.g., `ba.mp3`) and linking them in `letterData`.

*   **Visual Makhraj Diagrams:** Add a simple diagram of the mouth to the modal (popup box), showing where each letter is pronounced. Requires creating SVG images and linking them in `letterData`.

*   **Sifat (Attribute) Icons:** Show simple icons in the modal (popup box) for each letter's attributes (Sifat), like 'heavy' or 'light'. Requires designing icons and adding a `sifat` list to `letterData`.

*   **Animated Makhraj Diagrams (Advanced):** Animate the Makhraj diagrams in the modal (popup box) to show the muscle movement and airflow for pronouncing each letter with synchronized pronounciation sound.
